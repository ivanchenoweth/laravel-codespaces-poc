If accidentally you created a mysql volume by running sail without an .env file, which was persistent the whole time thus of course having no user and database configured.

I executed ./vendor/bin/sail down --rmi all -v to remove all images and volumes and then just ran ./vendor/bin/sail up and it created the images and volumes from scratch. 
Now everything worked out and I can migrate my data.
./vendor/bin/sail down --rmi all -v

Or, complete rebuild all the docker containers:
./vendor/bin/sail build --no-cache
